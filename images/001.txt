The V-neck outer collar features intricate embroidery with an outer border of cobalt blue, an inner border of white, and detailed geometric and stylized floral motifs in blue and white, centered with a round jewel-like embellishment. A soft pastel blue silk turban is worn on the head, reflecting traditional Vietnamese royal clothing style. The background is a neutral light beige/yellow. The image emphasizes high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
