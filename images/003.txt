studio portrait, photorealistic half-body image of a standing woman looking slightly to the right, wearing a rich red silk Nhat Binh outer robe. The robe is adorned with vibrant, intricate floral and bird embroidery in various colors like yellow, blue, and green, covering the fabric. The wide lantern sleeves have colorful striped cuffs in shades of light blue, white, yellow, and navy. She is wearing a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible). The V-neck outer collar is elaborately embroidered with multiple colorful layers, including yellow, white, and a darker border, featuring geometric and stylized floral motifs, centered with a large, round, ornate golden embellishment. A deep blue silk turban (mấn) is worn on her head. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The background is a clean white, highlighting high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
