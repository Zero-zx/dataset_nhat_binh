A half-body image of a standing woman facing forward, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of rich purple silk, extensively adorned with intricate colorful wave and cloud embroidery along the hem in shades of purple, pink, blue, and yellow, and also features delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs including cranes across the main body and sleeves. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes in red, green, blue, yellow, and white on one side and subtle embroidered patterns on the other. She wears a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a yellow inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, yellow, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a large round ornate golden embellishment at the center. A distinctive light purple hat adorned with several vibrant purple and pink artificial flowers is worn on her head. The background is a clean white. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
