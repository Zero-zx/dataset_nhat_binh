The neck area has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a yellow inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, yellow, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a large round ornate golden embellishment at the center. The woman wears a distinctive light purple hat adorned with several vibrant purple and pink artificial flowers on her head. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns. The background is a clean white.
