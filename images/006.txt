studio portrait, photorealistic half-body image of a standing woman facing forward, wearing a rich purple silk Nhat Binh outer robe. The robe is extensively adorned with intricate, colorful wave and cloud embroidery along the hem in shades of purple, pink, blue, and yellow, and also features delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs (including cranes) across the main body and sleeves. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white) on one side and subtle embroidered patterns on the other. She is wearing a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a yellow inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, yellow, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a large, round, ornate golden embellishment at the center. A distinctive light purple hat (mấn) adorned with several vibrant purple and pink artificial flowers is worn on her head. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The background is a clean white, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
