studio portrait, photorealistic full-body image of a standing woman facing forward with a gentle smile, wearing a rich crimson red silk Nhat Binh outer robe. The robe is extensively adorned with intricate, colorful wave and cloud embroidery along the hem in shades of blue, red, yellow, and green, and also features delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white). She is wearing white silk pants (partially visible) and a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a yellow inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, orange, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a large, round, ornate golden embellishment at the center. A deep blue silk turban (mấn) is worn on her head. She is also wearing dark shoes with golden tips. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The background is a textured light orange/beige, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
