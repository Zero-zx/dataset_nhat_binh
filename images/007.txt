A full-body image of a standing woman facing forward with a gentle smile, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of rich crimson red silk, extensively adorned with intricate colorful wave and cloud embroidery along the hem in shades of blue, red, yellow, and green, and also features delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes in red, green, blue, yellow, and white. She wears white silk pants and a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a yellow inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, orange, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a large round ornate golden embellishment at the center. A deep blue silk turban is worn on her head. She also wears dark shoes with golden tips. The background is a textured light orange/beige. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
