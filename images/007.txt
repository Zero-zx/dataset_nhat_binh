A full-body image of a standing woman wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of rich crimson red silk, extensively adorned with intricate colorful wave and cloud embroidery along the hem in shades of blue, red, yellow, and green, and also features delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves, with wide lantern sleeves having cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white). The neck area has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a yellow inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, orange, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a large round ornate golden embellishment at the center. The woman wears white silk pants and a deep blue silk turban on her head, along with dark shoes with golden tips. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns. The background is a textured light orange/beige.
