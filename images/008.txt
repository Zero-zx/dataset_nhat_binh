A full-body image of a standing woman looking slightly to the left, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of light purple silk, extensively adorned with intricate colorful wave and cloud embroidery along the hem in shades of blue, green, yellow, and red, and also features delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes in red, green, blue, yellow, and white. She wears white silk pants and a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible). The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and yellow geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A light purple silk turban is worn on her head. The background is a solid bright red. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
