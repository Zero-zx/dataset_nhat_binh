studio portrait, photorealistic full-body image of a standing woman looking slightly to the left, wearing a light purple silk Nhat Binh outer robe. The robe is extensively adorned with intricate, colorful wave and cloud embroidery along the hem in shades of blue, green, yellow, and red, and also features delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white). She is wearing white silk pants (partially visible) and a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible). The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and yellow geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A light purple silk turban (mấn) is worn on her head. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The background is a solid bright red, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
