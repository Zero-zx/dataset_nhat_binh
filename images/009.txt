studio portrait, photorealistic half-body image of a standing woman looking gracefully to her right with her eyes closed or downcast, holding a delicate wooden fan with intricate carvings to her face. She is wearing a rich purple silk Nhat Binh outer robe. The robe is extensively adorned with intricate, colorful floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white). She is wearing a yellow under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible). The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and yellow geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A deep purple silk turban (mấn) is worn on her head. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The background is a clean white, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
