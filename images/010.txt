A half-body image of a standing woman facing forward, looking directly at the viewer, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of bright white silk, extensively adorned with intricate colorful wave and cloud embroidery along the hem in shades of blue, red, yellow, and green, and also features delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves. Her left arm is slightly raised, with her hand near her head. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes in red, green, blue, yellow, and white. She wears a red under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible). The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and orange geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A white silk turban is worn on her head. The background is a solid deep red. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
