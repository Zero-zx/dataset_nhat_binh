studio portrait, photorealistic half-body image of a standing woman facing forward, looking directly at the viewer, wearing a bright white silk Nhat Binh outer robe. The robe is extensively adorned with intricate, colorful wave and cloud embroidery along the hem in shades of blue, red, yellow, and green, and also features delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves. Her left arm is slightly raised, with her hand near her head. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white). She is wearing a red under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible). The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and orange geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A white silk turban (mấn) is worn on her head. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The background is a solid deep red, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic
