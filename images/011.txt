studio portrait, photorealistic full-body image of a standing woman facing forward, looking directly at the viewer, wearing a soft white silk Nhat Binh outer robe with subtle tone-on-tone floral embroidery. The wide lantern sleeves have plain white cuffs. She is wearing a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle floral embroidery. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate light blue and white geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a subtle central embellishment. A light blue silk turban (mấn) is worn on her head. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The background is a solid black, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
