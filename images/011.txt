A full-body image of a standing woman facing forward, looking directly at the viewer, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of soft white silk with subtle tone-on-tone floral embroidery. The wide lantern sleeves have plain white cuffs. She wears a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle floral embroidery. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate light blue and white geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a subtle central embellishment. A light blue silk turban is worn on her head. The background is a solid black. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
