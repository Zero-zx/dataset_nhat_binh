studio portrait, photorealistic full-body image of a standing woman facing forward, looking directly at the viewer, wearing a bright yellow silk Nhat Binh outer robe. The robe is extensively adorned with intricate, colorful wave and cloud embroidery along the hem in shades of blue, red, yellow, and green, and also features delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs (including cranes) across the main body and sleeves. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with colorful circular and striped patterns. She is wearing red pants (partially visible) and a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, red, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A bright yellow silk turban (mấn) is worn on her head. She is also wearing red shoes. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The background is a clean white, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
