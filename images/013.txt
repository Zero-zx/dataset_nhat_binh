A half-body image of a standing woman wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of soft lavender purple silk with subtle tone-on-tone and light blue floral embroidery, with wide lantern sleeves having cuffs with pastel blue, white, and pink stripes. The neck area has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) with subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, light blue, and pink geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a subtle central embellishment. The woman wears a deep blue silk turban on her head. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns. The background is a vibrant gradient of pink and magenta.
