A half-body image of a standing woman looking gracefully to her left, with one hand gently resting on her chest, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of soft lavender purple silk with subtle tone-on-tone and light blue floral embroidery. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with pastel blue, white, and pink stripes. She wears a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, light blue, and pink geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a subtle central embellishment. A deep blue silk turban is worn on her head. The background is a vibrant gradient of pink and magenta with soft lighting. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
