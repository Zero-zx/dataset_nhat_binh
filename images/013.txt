studio portrait, photorealistic half-body image of a standing woman looking gracefully to her left, with one hand gently resting on her chest. She is wearing a soft lavender purple silk Nhat Binh outer robe with subtle tone-on-tone and light blue floral embroidery. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with pastel blue, white, and pink stripes. She is wearing a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, light blue, and pink geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a subtle central embellishment. A deep blue silk turban (mấn) is worn on her head. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The background is a vibrant gradient of pink and magenta, with soft lighting, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
