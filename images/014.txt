The neck area has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) with subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, yellow, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. The woman wears a flowing white silk skirt/pants with subtle floral embroidery along the hem and a wide-brimmed white hat on her head. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
