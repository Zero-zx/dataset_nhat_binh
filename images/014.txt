studio portrait, photorealistic full-body image of a standing woman in a playful or dynamic pose, looking down and to her left with a gentle smile. She is wearing a soft pink silk Nhat Binh outer robe, adorned with delicate floral and bird motifs and a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of pink, yellow, and purple. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with pastel blue, pink, yellow, and purple stripes. She is wearing flowing white silk pants/skirt with subtle embroidery along the hem. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white and light blue geometric and stylized floral motifs. Her hair is pulled back in a ponytail with a white ribbon, and she wears subtle earrings. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing with a modern, light aesthetic. The background is a clean white with soft shadows and natural lighting, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
