A full-body image of a standing woman in a playful or dynamic pose, looking down and to her left with a gentle smile, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of soft pink silk, adorned with delicate floral and bird motifs and a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of pink, yellow, and purple. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with pastel blue, pink, yellow, and purple stripes. She wears flowing white silk pants/skirt with subtle embroidery along the hem. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white and light blue geometric and stylized floral motifs. Her hair is pulled back in a ponytail with a white ribbon, and she wears subtle earrings. The background is a clean white with soft shadows and natural lighting. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
