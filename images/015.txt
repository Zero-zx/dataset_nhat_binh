studio portrait, photorealistic full-body image of a standing woman facing forward, looking directly at the viewer. She is wearing a soft pink silk Nhat Binh outer robe, adorned with delicate floral and bird motifs and a pastel, intricate wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of purple, blue, pink, and yellow. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with pastel blue, pink, and green stripes. She is wearing a flowing white silk skirt/pants with subtle floral embroidery along the hem. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, yellow, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A wide-brimmed white hat (mấn) is worn on her head. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing with a gentle aesthetic. The background is a clean white/light grey, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
