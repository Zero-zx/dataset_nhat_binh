A full-body image of a standing woman facing forward, looking directly at the viewer, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of soft pink silk, adorned with delicate floral and bird motifs and a pastel intricate wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of purple, blue, pink, and yellow. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with pastel blue, pink, and green stripes. She wears a flowing white silk skirt/pants with subtle floral embroidery along the hem. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, yellow, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A wide-brimmed white hat is worn on her head. The background is a clean white/light grey. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
