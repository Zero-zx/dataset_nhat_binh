A full-body image of a standing woman wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of soft white silk, with floral and geometric embroidery, and features wide lantern sleeves with pastel blue, pink, and yellow striped cuffs. The neck area has a tall white mandarin collar under-tunic (partially visible) with subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is intricately embroidered with an outer border of cobalt blue, an inner border of white, and detailed geometric and stylized floral motifs in blue and white, centered with a round jewel-like embellishment. The woman wears white silk pants and a soft pastel blue silk turban on her head. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns. The background is a neutral light beige/yellow.
