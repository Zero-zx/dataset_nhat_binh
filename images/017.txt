A full-body image of a standing woman facing forward, looking directly at the viewer, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of rich cobalt blue silk, extensively adorned with intricate colorful wave and cloud embroidery along the hem in shades of blue, red, yellow, and green, and also features delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes in red, green, blue, yellow, and white. She wears a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and yellow geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A deep blue silk turban is worn on her head. She holds a small folded fan in her hands. The background is a clean white. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
