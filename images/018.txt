studio portrait, photorealistic half-body image of a standing woman facing forward, looking directly at the viewer with a confident expression. She is wearing a stately black silk Nhat Binh outer robe, extensively adorned with intricate, colorful circular motifs featuring birds and floral patterns across the main body and sleeves. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white). Along the lower part of the robe, a detailed panel with red, blue, and yellow embroidery depicts a phoenix or similar bird. She is wearing a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle floral patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, red, and gold geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A black silk turban (mấn) is worn on her head. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The background is a solid bright red, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
