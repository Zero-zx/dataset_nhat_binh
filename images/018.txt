A half-body image of a standing woman wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of stately black silk, extensively adorned with intricate colorful circular motifs featuring birds and floral patterns across the main body and sleeves, with a detailed panel along the lower part depicting a phoenix with red, blue, and yellow embroidery, and wide lantern sleeves having cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white). The neck area has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) with subtle floral patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, red, and gold geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. The woman wears a black silk turban on her head. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns. The background is a solid bright red.
