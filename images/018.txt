A half-body image of a standing woman facing forward, looking directly at the viewer with a confident expression, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of stately black silk, extensively adorned with intricate colorful circular motifs featuring birds and floral patterns across the main body and sleeves. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes in red, green, blue, yellow, and white. Along the lower part of the robe, a detailed panel with red, blue, and yellow embroidery depicts a phoenix or similar bird. She wears a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle floral patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, red, and gold geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A black silk turban is worn on her head. The background is a solid bright red. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
