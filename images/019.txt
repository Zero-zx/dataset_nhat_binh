A full-body image of a standing woman wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of stately black silk, extensively adorned with intricate colorful circular motifs featuring birds and floral patterns across the main body and sleeves, with vibrant wave and cloud embroidery along the lower part in shades of blue, red, yellow, and green, and wide lantern sleeves having cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white). The neck area has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) with subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, red, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. The woman wears white silk pants and a black silk turban on her head, along with red shoes. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns. The background is a clean white.
