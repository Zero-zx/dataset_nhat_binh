studio portrait, photorealistic full-body image of a standing woman facing forward, looking directly at the viewer. She is wearing a stately black silk Nhat Binh outer robe, extensively adorned with intricate, colorful circular motifs featuring birds and floral patterns across the main body and sleeves. Along the lower part of the robe, a detailed panel with vibrant wave and cloud embroidery in shades of blue, red, yellow, and green. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white). She is wearing white silk pants (partially visible) and a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, red, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A black silk turban (mấn) is worn on her head. She is also wearing red shoes. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The background is a clean white, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
