A full-body image of a standing woman looking gracefully to her left, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of rich blue silk, extensively adorned with intricate colorful wave and cloud embroidery along the hem in shades of blue, red, yellow, and green, and also features delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes in red, yellow, blue, and white. She wears white silk pants and a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and yellow geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A wide-brimmed black hat is worn on her head, with her hair styled elegantly underneath. She holds a small folded fan in her hands. The background is a solid bright red. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
