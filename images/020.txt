studio portrait, photorealistic full-body image of a standing woman looking gracefully to her left. She is wearing a rich blue silk Nhat Binh outer robe, extensively adorned with intricate, colorful wave and cloud embroidery along the hem in shades of blue, red, yellow, and green, and also features delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, yellow, blue, white). She is wearing white silk pants (partially visible) and a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and yellow geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A wide-brimmed black hat (mấn) is worn on her head, with her hair styled elegantly underneath. She holds a small, folded fan in her hands. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The background is a solid bright red, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
