A full-body image of a standing woman wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of bright yellow silk, extensively adorned with intricate colorful wave and cloud embroidery along the hem in shades of blue, red, yellow, and green, and also features delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves, with wide lantern sleeves having cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white). The neck area has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) with subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and yellow geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. The woman wears white silk pants and a deep blue silk turban on her head, along with red shoes, and holds a large open deep blue fan. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns. The background is a clean white.
