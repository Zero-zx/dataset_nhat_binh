studio portrait, photorealistic full-body image of a standing woman facing forward, looking directly at the viewer. She is wearing a soft sage green silk Nhat Binh outer robe, extensively adorned with delicate floral and geometric motifs, and a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of blue, green, and pink. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with pastel green, blue, and pink stripes. She is wearing a dark under-layer visible at the bottom. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible). The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white and light blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A deep blue silk turban (mấn) is worn on her head. She holds a small, white fan in her left hand. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The background is a solid deep brown, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
