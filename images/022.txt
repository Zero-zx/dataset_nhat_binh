A full-body image of a standing woman wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of soft sage green silk, delicate floral and geometric motifs, and a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of blue, green, and pink, wide lantern sleeves having cuffs with pastel green, blue, and pink stripes. The neck area has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible). The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white and light blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. The woman wears a dark under-layer visible at the bottom and a deep blue silk turban on her head, and holds a small white fan in her left hand. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns. The background is a solid deep brown.
