The outer robe is made of rich crimson red silk, extensively adorned with delicate floral and bird motifs, and a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of white, orange, and blue. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes in red, green, blue, yellow, and white. She wears a flowing white silk skirt/pants with subtle embroidered motifs. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, orange, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A deep blue silk turban is worn on her head. She also wears white shoes. The background is a solid dark green. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
