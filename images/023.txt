studio portrait, photorealistic full-body image of a standing woman looking gracefully to her right, with a serious expression. She is wearing a rich crimson red silk Nhat Binh outer robe, extensively adorned with delicate floral and bird motifs, and a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of white, orange, and blue. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white). She is wearing a flowing white silk skirt/pants (partially visible) with subtle embroidered motifs. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, orange, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A deep blue silk turban (mấn) is worn on her head. She is also wearing white shoes. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The background is a solid dark green, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
