studio portrait, photorealistic half-body image of a standing woman looking down at a pink lotus flower she is holding delicately in her hands. She is wearing a soft pink silk Nhat Binh outer robe, extensively adorned with delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs (including cranes) across the main body and sleeves, and a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of pink, purple, and blue. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white). She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a yellow inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, yellow, and pink geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a large, round, ornate golden embellishment at the center. A light pink striped hat (mấn) is worn on her head. Small pink flower petals are delicately placed on her cheek, adding a whimsical touch. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing with a soft, ethereal aesthetic. The background is a clean white/light grey, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography style.
