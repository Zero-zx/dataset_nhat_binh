A half-body image of a standing woman looking down at a pink lotus flower she is holding delicately in her hands, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of soft pink silk, extensively adorned with delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs including cranes across the main body and sleeves, and a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of pink, purple, and blue. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes in red, green, blue, yellow, and white. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a yellow inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, yellow, and pink geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a large round ornate golden embellishment at the center. A light pink striped hat is worn on her head. Small pink flower petals are delicately placed on her cheek, adding a whimsical touch. The background is a clean white/light grey. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
