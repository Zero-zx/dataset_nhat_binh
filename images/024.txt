A half-body image of a standing woman wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of soft pink silk, delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs including cranes across the main body and sleeves, and a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of pink, purple, and blue, wide lantern sleeves having cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white). The neck area has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a yellow inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, yellow, and pink geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a large round ornate golden embellishment at the center. The woman wears a light pink striped hat on her head and holds a pink lotus flower in her hands. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns. The background is a clean white/light grey.
