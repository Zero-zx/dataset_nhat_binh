studio portrait, photorealistic full-body image of a standing woman looking gracefully to her left, with one hand slightly raised. She is wearing a soft pink silk Nhat Binh outer robe, extensively adorned with delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves, and a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of pink, purple, and blue. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with pastel blue, pink, yellow, and purple stripes. She is wearing a layered white and colorful embroidered skirt/pants (partially visible). She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, yellow, and pink geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. She wears a long pearl necklace. A light pink striped hat (mấn) is worn on her head. She holds a small, light-colored fan in her other hand. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing with a soft, elegant aesthetic. The background is a solid deep brown, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography style.
