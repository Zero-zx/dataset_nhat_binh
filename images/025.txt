A full-body image of a standing woman looking gracefully to her left, with one hand slightly raised, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of soft pink silk, extensively adorned with delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves, and a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of pink, purple, and blue. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with pastel blue, pink, yellow, and purple stripes. She wears a layered white and colorful embroidered skirt/pants. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, yellow, and pink geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. She wears a long pearl necklace. A light pink striped hat is worn on her head. She holds a small light-colored fan in her other hand. The background is a solid deep brown. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
