A full-body image of a standing woman wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of soft pink silk, delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves, and a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of pink, purple, and blue, wide lantern sleeves having cuffs with pastel blue, pink, yellow, and purple stripes. The neck area has a white under-tunic and a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) with subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, yellow, and pink geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. The woman wears a layered white and colorful embroidered skirt/pants, a long pearl necklace, and a light pink striped hat on her head, and holds a small light-colored fan in her hand. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns. The background is a solid deep brown.
