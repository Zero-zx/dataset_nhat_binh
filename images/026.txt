A half-body image of a standing woman wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of soft white silk, delicate floral, cloud, and mythical creature motifs possibly dragons or phoenixes across the main body and sleeves, with a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of pink, purple, blue, and green, and vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white) on the cuffs and a decorative sash, wide lantern sleeves. The neck area has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a yellow inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, yellow, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a large round ornate golden embellishment at the center. The woman wears a white wide-brimmed hat adorned with several delicate pink artificial flowers on her head and holds a translucent pink woven bag. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns. The background is a clean white/light grey.
