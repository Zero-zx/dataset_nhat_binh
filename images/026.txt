studio portrait, photorealistic half-body image of a standing woman looking down with a gentle expression, her hand delicately touching her neck. She is wearing a soft white silk Nhat Binh outer robe, extensively adorned with delicate floral, cloud, and mythical creature motifs (possibly dragons or phoenixes) across the main body and sleeves. The robe features a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of pink, purple, blue, and green, along with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white) on the cuffs and a decorative sash. She is holding a translucent pink woven bag. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a yellow inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, yellow, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a large, round, ornate golden embellishment at the center. A white wide-brimmed hat (mấn) adorned with several delicate pink artificial flowers is worn on her head. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing with a soft and elegant aesthetic. The background is a clean white/light grey, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography style.
