A half-body image of a standing woman looking down with a gentle expression, her hand delicately touching her neck, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of soft white silk, extensively adorned with delicate floral, cloud, and mythical creature motifs possibly dragons or phoenixes across the main body and sleeves. The robe features a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of pink, purple, blue, and green, along with vibrant multi-colored stripes in red, green, blue, yellow, and white on the cuffs and a decorative sash. She is holding a translucent pink woven bag. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a yellow inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, yellow, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a large round ornate golden embellishment at the center. A white wide-brimmed hat adorned with several delicate pink artificial flowers is worn on her head. The background is a clean white/light grey. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
