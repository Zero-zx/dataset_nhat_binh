A full-body image of a standing woman in a graceful pose, looking down to her left with a serene expression, with one arm extended outwards, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of light silver-grey silk, extensively adorned with delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves, and a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of blue, purple, and green. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes in red, green, blue, yellow, and white. She wears flowing orange under-garments possibly a skirt or pants visible beneath the robe. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a subtle orange inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, red, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. She holds a light-colored open fan in her other hand. A deep blue silk turban is worn on her head. The background is a solid black. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
