studio portrait, photorealistic full-body image of a standing woman in a graceful pose, looking down to her left with a serene expression, with one arm extended outwards. She is wearing a light silver-grey silk Nhat Binh outer robe, extensively adorned with delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves, and a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of blue, purple, and green. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white). She is wearing flowing orange under-garments (possibly a skirt or pants) visible beneath the robe. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a subtle orange inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, red, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. She holds a light-colored, open fan in her other hand. A deep blue silk turban (mấn) is worn on her head. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing with a graceful aesthetic. The background is a solid black, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography style.
