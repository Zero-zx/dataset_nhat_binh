A full-body image of a standing woman wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of light silver-grey silk, delicate floral, cloud, and bird motifs across the main body and sleeves, and a colorful wave/cloud pattern along the hem in shades of blue, purple, and green, wide lantern sleeves having cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, green, blue, yellow, white). The neck area has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a subtle orange inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, red, and blue geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. The woman wears flowing orange under-garments possibly a skirt or pants visible beneath the robe, a deep blue silk turban on her head, and holds a light-colored open fan in her hand. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns. The background is a solid black.
