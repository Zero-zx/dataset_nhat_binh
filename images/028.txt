studio portrait, photorealistic full-body image of a standing woman looking thoughtfully to her left. She is wearing a deep navy blue silk Nhat Binh outer robe, with subtle embroidery. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, yellow, blue, white) on one side. She is holding a white lotus flower in her hands, along with a colorful fabric strip. She is wearing a flowing white silk skirt/pants with subtle floral and bird embroidery along the hem, accented with a yellow and blue border. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and delicate embroidery. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and orange geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A deep blue silk turban (mấn) is worn on her head. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The background is a solid light pink, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography aesthetic.
