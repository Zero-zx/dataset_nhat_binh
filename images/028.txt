A full-body image of a standing woman looking thoughtfully to her left, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of deep navy blue silk with subtle embroidery. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes in red, yellow, blue, and white on one side. She is holding a white lotus flower in her hands, along with a colorful fabric strip. She wears a flowing white silk skirt/pants with subtle floral and bird embroidery along the hem, accented with a yellow and blue border. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and delicate embroidery. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and orange geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A deep blue silk turban is worn on her head. The background is a solid light pink. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
