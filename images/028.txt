A full-body image of a standing woman wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of deep navy blue silk with subtle embroidery, wide lantern sleeves having cuffs with vibrant multi-colored stripes (red, yellow, blue, white) on one side. The neck area has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) with delicate embroidery. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and orange geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. The woman wears a flowing white silk skirt/pants with subtle floral and bird embroidery along the hem accented with a yellow and blue border, a deep blue silk turban on her head, and holds a white lotus flower in her hands along with a colorful fabric strip. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns. The background is a solid light pink.
