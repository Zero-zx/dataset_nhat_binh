studio portrait, photorealistic half-body image of a standing woman looking gracefully to her left with a gentle smile. She is wearing a soft pink silk Nhat Binh outer robe, adorned with subtle floral and geometric motifs. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with pastel purple, white, and blue stripes. She is holding a white lotus bud in one hand and a light pink folded fan in the other. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a subtle pink inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and pink geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A deep blue silk turban (mấn) is worn on her head. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing with a soft, elegant aesthetic. The background is a solid deep brown, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography style.
