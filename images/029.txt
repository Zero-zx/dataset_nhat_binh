A half-body image of a standing woman wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of soft pink silk, adorned with subtle floral and geometric motifs, wide lantern sleeves having cuffs with pastel purple, white, and blue stripes. The neck area has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a subtle pink inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and pink geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. The woman wears a deep blue silk turban on her head, holds a white lotus bud in one hand and a light pink folded fan in the other. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns. The background is a solid deep brown.
