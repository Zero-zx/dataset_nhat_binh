A half-body image of a standing woman looking gracefully to her left with a gentle smile, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of soft pink silk, adorned with subtle floral and geometric motifs. The wide lantern sleeves have cuffs with pastel purple, white, and blue stripes. She is holding a white lotus bud in one hand and a light pink folded fan in the other. She has a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and a subtle pink inner collar. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and pink geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A deep blue silk turban is worn on her head. The background is a solid deep brown. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
