studio portrait, photorealistic full-body image of a standing woman facing forward, looking directly at the viewer with a serious expression. She is wearing a rustic red silk Nhat Binh outer robe, adorned with subtle gold circular and floral motifs. The wide lantern sleeves have golden-edged cuffs. She is wearing flowing white silk pants (partially visible) and a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and gold geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A deep blue silk turban (mấn) is worn on her head. She is also wearing brown embroidered shoes. The overall style reflects traditional Vietnamese royal clothing with a slightly antique aesthetic. The background is a clean white/light grey, emphasizing high detail, intricate textile patterns, and a historical costume photography style.
