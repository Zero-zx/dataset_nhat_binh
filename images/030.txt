A full-body image of a standing woman facing forward, looking directly at the viewer with a serious expression, wearing a Nhat Binh outfit, traditional Vietnamese royal clothing. The outer robe is made of rustic red silk, adorned with subtle gold circular and floral motifs. The wide lantern sleeves have golden-edged cuffs. She wears flowing white silk pants and a white under-tunic with a tall mandarin collar (partially visible) and subtle patterns. The V-neck outer collar is richly embroidered with intricate white, blue, and gold geometric and stylized floral motifs, and a central jewel-like embellishment. A deep blue silk turban is worn on her head. She also wears brown embroidered shoes. The background is a clean white/light grey. The image emphasizes high detail and intricate textile patterns.
